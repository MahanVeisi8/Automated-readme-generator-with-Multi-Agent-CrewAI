The project utilizes multiple agents, each with specific tasks such as scanning directories, reading content, analyzing information, and producing the final `README.md`. By breaking down the task of creating documentation into smaller, manageable steps, this approach significantly reduces the manual effort required to maintain high-quality project documentation."

            "These enhancements to the reward function are crucial for guiding the agent towards more desirable behaviors and are directly integrated into the training loop of the `Model_TrainTest` class. By adjusting the rewards based on the pole's angle and the cart's position, we significantly increase the stability and performance of the agent, making it adept at maintaining balance under varying conditions. Without it, our agent might still understand the best desicion but it will happen in much more epochs.\n",

Through progressive training, the model showcased significant improvements in strategy and performance, achieving stability and high accuracy in balancing the pole.

            "Through this project, we developed and compared three models‚ÄîDecision Tree, Neural Network, and Random Forest‚Äîto optimize the Readahead feature under varying workloads. Both the Decision Tree and Random Forest models achieved perfect accuracy, demonstrating their strength in handling this classification task. The Neural Network, while slightly less accurate, offered flexibility in model design and captured complex relationships within the data. Given these results, the Random Forest model stands out for its combination of accuracy and interpretability, making it a strong candidate for real-time systems that require dynamic adjustment of Readahead sizes based on current workloads.\n",
