# 🚀 Automated README Generator using Multi-Agent CrewAI 🤖

This repository showcases a **fully automated** system for generating a professional and well-structured `README.md` file. Leveraging **Multi-Agent CrewAI** combined with powerful models like **LLaMA 3 - 70B**, the system analyzes project structures, preferred documentation styles, and code details to automatically produce a stunning README!

🔗 **References to Previous Work**  
This project builds upon previous implementations from [**Readahead Optimization using ML Models**](https://github.com/MahanVeisi8/Readahead-Optimization-Using-ML-Models) and leverages the README style from projects like [**RL Practices - DQN**](https://github.com/MahanVeisi8/RL_practices/tree/main/Cartpole/1%20-%20DQN).

### Key Features:
- **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: Uses multiple agents in CREW AI to divide the work and generate comprehensive documentation.
- **Automated Style Detection**: Learns the preferred README style based on project specifications.
- **Code Analysis and Readability**: Reviews the codebase and ensures accurate technical descriptions.

## 🤖 How CrewAI Works

The automated README generator employs **CrewAI** agents, each with specialized roles:

### 1. Analyzing Style 📝

The **Style Analyzer Agent** learns the desired structure and style from past READMEs (e.g., [RL Practices](https://github.com/MahanVeisi8/RL_practices/tree/main/Cartpole/1%20-%20DQN)). This allows the generated README to align with specific formatting and tone preferences.

### 2. Code Structure Review 💻

The **Code Review Agent** reads through the repository's code, especially projects like [Readahead Optimization using ML Models](https://github.com/MahanVeisi8/Readahead-Optimization-Using-ML-Models), to extract the essential technical details for inclusion in the README.

### 3. Generating README 📄

The **README Generator Agent** merges the findings from the style and code analysis, formatting the final README. It ensures the documentation is coherent, professional, and—let's not forget—fun with emojis and creative elements!
