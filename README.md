## ü§ñ How CrewAI Works

The automated README generator employs **CrewAI** agents, each with specialized roles:

### 1. Analyzing Style üìù

The **Style Analyzer Agent** learns the desired structure and style from past READMEs (e.g., [RL Practices](https://github.com/MahanVeisi8/RL_practices/tree/main/Cartpole/1%20-%20DQN)). This allows the generated README to align with specific formatting and tone preferences.

### 2. Code Structure Review üíª

The **Code Review Agent** reads through the repository's code, especially projects like [Readahead Optimization using ML Models](https://github.com/MahanVeisi8/Readahead-Optimization-Using-ML-Models), to extract the essential technical details for inclusion in the README.

### 3. Generating README üìÑ

The **README Generator Agent** merges the findings from the style and code analysis, formatting the final README. It ensures the documentation is coherent, professional, and‚Äîlet's not forget‚Äîfun with emojis and creative elements!
